# ** Xavier Piedallu – From Public Works to Web Development 🏗️➡️💻**

## **👨‍💻 About Me**

Hello! I’m **Xavier Piedallu**, a passionate and dedicated **Junior Web Developer** currently completing my training at **Holberton School Thonon-les-Bains**. My journey into tech is unique—I come from a **Public Works (Travaux Publics) background** 🏗️, where I spent several years managing construction projects, handling logistics, and leading teams under tight deadlines.

This experience shaped my ability to **analyze problems, organize efficiently, and adapt quickly**—all of which are crucial skills in web development. Today, I am bringing the same discipline and precision to my work in programming, eager to transform ideas into functional and efficient digital solutions. 💡

## **🌟 My Transition to Web Development**

After several years in Public Works, I decided to pivot into the world of **software development**, driven by my curiosity for technology and my desire to create impactful digital tools. I joined **Holberton School**, where I have been immersing myself in:

- **🎨 Front-end Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **⚙️ Back-end Development:** Python, Django, Flask
- **🗄️ Database Management:** MySQL, SQLite
- **🔄 Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **🔗 REST API Development**

I thrive on learning and problem-solving, and I am excited to apply my growing skillset to real-world projects. 🚀
